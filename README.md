# 🧮 Python Calculator (Function-Based)

A simple yet interactive **command-line calculator** built in Python that performs basic arithmetic operations using function mapping.
The calculator allows continuous calculations using the previous result, making it more practical and user-friendly.

## 🚀 Features

* Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division
* Function dictionary (operation mapping)
* Continuous calculation with previous result
* Clean CLI interface
* Restart option

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* Python 3

## 📂 Project Structure

* `main.py` → calculator logic
* `art.py` → ASCII logo

## ▶️ How to Run

1️⃣ Clone the repository

```bash
git clone (https://github.com/shivanshuchaudhary-git/calcy)
```

2️⃣ Open the project folder

3️⃣ Run the program

```bash
python main.py
```

## 💡 How It Works

1. User enters the first number
2. Selects an operation (+, -, *, /)
3. Inputs second number
4. Program calculates result using mapped functions
5. User can continue with the result or restart

## 📚 Concepts Practiced

* Functions and return values
* Dictionaries for function mapping
* Loops and program flow
* Recursion (restart logic)
* CLI interaction
